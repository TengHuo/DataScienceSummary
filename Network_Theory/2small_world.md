## Degree distribution - Power Law

**Power law** is a functional relationship $p(k) = k^{-a}$ quantities, where one quantity varies as a power of another

## Preferential Attachments

- Nodes arrive in order $1,2,...,n$ 
- At step j, let $d_i$ be the degree of node $i<j$
- A new node j arrives and creates m out-links
- Probability of j linking to a previous node i is proportional to the degree of node i, that is $d_i$.

$$
P(j\rightarrow i) = \frac{d_i}{\sum_kd_k}
$$

**Rich get Richer**: New nodes are more likely to link to nodes that already have high degree.
