### Degree Distribution of a Random Graph

What is P(k)?

- P(k) denotes the fraction of nodes with degree k.
- P(k) has the Binomial distribution.

$$
P(k) = \left(\begin{matrix}n-1 \\k\end{matrix}\right) p^k (1-p)^{n-1-k}
$$

Mean and variance of a Binomial distribution

$$
E(k) = \bar k = p(n-1)
$$

$$
\sigma^2 = p(1-p)(n-1)
$$

## Degree distribution - Power Law

**Power law** is a functional relationship $p(k) = k^{-a}$ quantities, where one quantity varies as a power of another
