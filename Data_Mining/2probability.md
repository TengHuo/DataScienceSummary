## Probability and Likelihood

## Estimation

There are two primary methods of estimation:

### 1. Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)

- Used for estimating the parameter values of a model so that the **likelihood** of some hypothesis being true is **maximized**,
- A frequentist method whereby the parameters of apopulation are considered having fixed (specific), but unknown values,
- With Maximum Likelihood Estimation, we often **ignore priors**.

### 2. Bayesian Estimation

- Used for estimating parameter values of a model based on the philosophy that the outcome is based on a data set which has a distribution of possible values,
- With Bayesian Estimation, we consider prior distributions

## Distributions and Densities

**domain**: set of possible values that a variable x can take
e.g. x is a month, its domain would be the set of 12 months in the calendar

**probability distribution** of the data: the probability of occurrence for each possible value in the domain of x
